# Complaint-box

The Complaints Box is a web application that allows users to anonymously submit complaints. Users can enter their complaints into a text area and submit them using a form. Submitted complaints are displayed in a list below the form, providing a log of all complaints. The application features a clean and responsive design, ensuring a user-friendly experience. While the initial implementation displays complaints only for the current session, it can be extended to save complaints to local storage for persistence across sessions
